## INTRODUCTION  
  
In order to satisfy as many users as possible MyBB is available in a multitude of languages. By default MyBB is installed with the American English language files, but thanks to many volunteers MyBB is also available in other languages. This language pack will allow you to use MyBB in Polish.  
  
## INSTALLATION  
  
The Polish text is stored in language files, which are packed in an archive file together with this readme and the Polish translation of this readme.  
  
This readme, the Polish readme are in the main folder. A file called `polish.php` is in a subfolder called `inc/languages`. The files containing the translations of the text for the front end are in a subfolder called `inc/languages/polish` and the files containing the translations of the text for the admin end are in its subfolder called `admin`.  
  
You will have to create the same folder structure on your server and place the language files in those folders. Below are extensive instructions on how to do this. We will assume you have already extracted the contents of the archive to your computer, which means the files are already available and the folder structure is as it should be. We will also assume you know how to use an FTP program to connect to your server. The tasks below should be executable with any FTP program.  
  
1. Open your FTP program and connect to your server.    
  
2. Navigate with your FTP program to the folder on your server in which you installed MyBB.    
  
3. Copy folder `inc` from your computer to this folder on the server.    
  
You have now uploaded all necessary files to the server. Read the following paragraphs for more information on how to enable the Polish language on your board.  
  
## USAGE  
  
After uploading the required files you can use the Polish translation for your copy of MyBB. We will hereafter discuss how to use the Polish translation for the front end of the board, how to use the Polish translation for the admin area of the board and how to set the Polish translation as the default language for your board. The default language will be used by guests and users who haven't set a language preference.  
  
* To use the Polish language for the front end of the board, a user should go to the User CP and click Edit Options. Then he can select Polish as "Board Language" below "Other options".    
  
* To set the Polish language as the default language for your board, an administrator should go to the Admin CP and click the Configuration tab. He will see "General Configuration" at the top of the list. He should click on that title. Then he can select Polish below "Default Language" and click "Save Settings" to submit the changes.    
  
* To use the Polish language for the admin part of the board, an administrator should go to the Admin CP and click the Configuration tab. At the bottom of the list he will see "Control Panel Preferences (Global)". He should click on that title. Then he can select Polish below "Control Panel Language" and click "Save Settings" to submit the changes.
